# Data_Visualization_of_COVID19
With Python coding, I analyzed to get the data visualization to see how much COVID 19 was spread across the US and which state specifically is vulnerable

## Background
With COVID 19 spreading in the US recently, it is important to analyze the data visualization of COVID 19 to see the severity of the pandemic and see which state is specifically vulnerable with the given data. Thus, it is crucial to ask: How can data visualizations help county and state leadership or business owners in the US, and what other data might be needed to better understand the impact of COVID-19?

Using [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports), [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), [US County](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json) data, I created the choropleth gif map that shows the number of cases by representing the reported cases per 1,000 people in US counties.

Now, we will look at the state that has one of the highest numbers of cases.

### New York

New York is one of the states that have the most coronavirus cases.
I believe that the reason is that New York is a famous city to tour; therefore, many foreigners probably traveled to New York to escape the pandemic in their own countries. 
Also, JFK airport is one of the biggest airports in the US that connects to many different states. 

## Summary and Implication
COVID 19 cases were high in the major cities. Therefore, the US should ban other foreigners from coming into the country, and residents of the major cities should strictly participate in social distancing. By looking at these data visualizations of COVID 19, government leaders should plan future actions in order to stop the spread. The state governors should give these data resources to citizens so that they recognize the severity of the pandemic in their own state.
