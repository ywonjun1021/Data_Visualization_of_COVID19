# Data_Visualization_of_COVID19
With Python coding, I analyzed the data visualization to see how much COVID 19 was spread across the US and which state specifically is vulnerable

## Background
Recently, COVID 19 spread across the United States, causing numerous cases, injuries, and death. With the available data, it is important to analyze the data visualization of COVID 19 to see the severity of the pandemic, and see which state is specifically vulneralbe. Thus, it is crucial to ask: How can data visualizations help county and state leadership or business owners in the US, and what other data might be needed to better understand the impact of COVID-19?
